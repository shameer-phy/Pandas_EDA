# Description

The questions document contains a set of 10 questions which should be answered using Pandas library of Python and by analyzing the Covid dataset provided.

The solutions.py file can be directly executed to get the solutions. I have used Spyder editor for this exercise. You can also find the outputs,shown in Ipython terminal after execution, in the outputs.pdf file saved in this folder.
